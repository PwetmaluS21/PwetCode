/*
4.	A prime number is a number that is evenly divisible
only by itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime
because it can be evenly divided only by 1 and 5. The number 6,
however, is not prime because it can be divided evenly by 1,
2, 3, and 6. Write a C++ program using function which takes an
integer as an argument and returns true if the argument is a
prime number, or false otherwise. Demonstrate the function in
a complete C++ program.
